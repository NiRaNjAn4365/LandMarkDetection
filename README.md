#Landmark Detection

This Android application utilizes CameraX and TensorFlow Lite for real-time landmark detection, specifically focusing on famous Asian landmarks with an accuracy of 60-70%. By using a pre-trained model (landmarks_classifier_asia_V1.tflite), the app can identify landmarks like the Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China directly from the deviceâ€™s camera feed. Built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, the app offers a seamless and intuitive user experience. Upon launching, users can point their camera at a landmark, and the app will classify it, displaying the name and confidence score in real time. While the current version supports classification-only without bounding boxes, future updates may introduce object detection and expand the model to cover global landmarks. This lightweight and efficient application is designed for offline use, ensuring quick and accurate results without requiring an internet connection.
